# GTea

Welcome to the GTea repository! GTea is the online version of GraphTea, an open-source software designed for high-quality standards and released under the GPL license. It serves as a perfect tool for students, teachers, researchers, game developers, and many more.

GraphTea is available at [www.graphtheorysoftware.com](http://www.graphtheorysoftware.com/). For more details about the source code and issue tracker, please visit our [GitHub page](https://github.com/rostam/GTea).

## Architecture

GTea operates on a Java server, which receives requests from the server and passes them to the GraphTea model. The results, which can be a graph, number, or string, are packed into a JSON and sent back to the JavaScript (JS) client. The JS client, which has been completely rewritten, handles the received JSON based on the selected actions.
